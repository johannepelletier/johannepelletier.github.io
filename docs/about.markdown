## Evaluating of the direct and indirect effects of human activities on forested and agricultural ecosystems, with the goal of mitigating climate change, supporting conservation and adaptation, and improving the livelihoods of forest-dependent people and smallholder farmers.



**<span style="color:blue">These interests are pursued using remote sensing along with other
quantitative methods and are oriented toward providing policy-relevant
information and evidence to support decision-making in developing
countries.</span>**

1)  Improve estimates of carbon emissions and removals from human
    activities.

2)  Understand drivers of change in biodiversity and ecosystem
    functions due to ecological and anthropogenic factors across
    different forest ecosystems.

3)  Assess the impact of innovations aimed at improving social and
    environmental outcomes using Earth Observation data.
