## Causal Inference with Predicted Outcomes: A satellite-based impact assessment of ‘Direct Seed Marketing’ in Ethiopia

Recent advances in earth observation and machine learning have opened
new frontiers in impact evaluation that appear well-suited for
agricultural settings. We apply these promising methods in the context
of Ethiopia’s Direct Seed Marketing (DSM) program, which rolled out
after 2011 and aims to enhance farmer access to improved seed varieties.
Our satellite-based impact assessment focuses on maize productivity as a
summary outcome. Satellite-based yield predictions enable a
high-resolution, landscape-level analysis of DSM impacts using a
difference-in-difference identification strategy, but yield prediction
errors introduce new sources of potential bias in subsequent causal
inference. We test for this prediction error bias and compare our DSM
impact estimates to those that use farmer-reported and crop cut yield
measures. We find evidence of small positive but insignificant effects
of the DSM on maize yield, explore how errors in predicted yields
introduce bias in causal estimation, and discuss implications for the
selection of prediction models.
